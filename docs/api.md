# API reference

DelayKit's TypeScript types are the canonical reference. Hover any method in your editor for full signatures and inline docstrings. The table below is for at-a-glance lookup.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `dk.handle(name, handler)` | Register a handler (before start/poll/createHandler) |
| `dk.schedule(handler, opts)` | Schedule a one-time job |
| `dk.debounce(handler, opts)` | Debounce rapid events into one handler call |
| `dk.throttle(handler, opts)` | Throttle to one handler call per time window |
| `dk.cancel(id)` | Cancel a pending job by ID |
| `dk.unschedule(handler, key)` | Cancel by handler and key |
| `dk.getJob(id)` | Look up a job by ID |
| `dk.getJobByKey(handler, key)` | Look up the active job for a handler + key |
| `dk.stats()` | Snapshot of job counts by status, with per-handler breakdown |
| `dk.retryJob(id)` | Reactivate a failed job with a fresh attempt budget |
| `dk.poll(opts?)` | Run one poll cycle (for cron routes) |
| `dk.createHandler()` | Create a webhook route handler (for external schedulers) |
| `dk.on(event, listener)` | Subscribe to lifecycle events |

## Duration format

Delays and timeouts use human-readable strings: `"5s"`, `"30m"`, `"24h"`, `"14d"`, `"500ms"`. Compound durations work too: `"1h30m"`.

| Unit | Example |
|------|---------|
| `ms` | `"500ms"` |
| `s` | `"30s"` |
| `m` | `"5m"` |
| `h` | `"24h"` |
| `d` | `"14d"` |
